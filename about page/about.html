        <h2>Branching and Merging</h2>
        <p>
          The Git feature that really makes it stand apart from nearly every other SCM out there is its branching model.
          <br>
          Git allows and encourages you to have multiple local branches that can be entirely independent of each other. The creation, merging, and deletion of those lines of development takes seconds.
          <br>
          This means that you can do things like:
          <ul style="margin-left: 1em;">
          <li>Frictionless Context Switching. Create a branch to try out an idea, commit a few times, switch back to where you branched from, apply a patch, switch back to where you are experimenting, and merge it in.</li>
            <li>Role-Based Code lines. Have a branch that always contains only what goes to production, another that you merge work into for testing, and several smaller ones for day to day work.</li>
            <li>Feature Based Workflow. Create new branches for each new feature you're working on so you can seamlessly switch back and forth between them, then delete each branch when that feature gets merged into your main line.</li>
            <li>Disposable Experimentation. Create a branch to experiment in, realize it's not going to work, and just delete it - abandoning the workâ€”with nobody else ever seeing it (even if you've pushed other branches in the meantime).</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <h2>Small and Fast</h2>
        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: var(--fw-weight);">> Git is fast.</span>
          <br>
          With Git, nearly all operations are performed locally, giving it a huge speed advantage on centralized systems that constantly have to communicate with a server somewhere.
          <br>
          Git was built to work on the Linux kernel, meaning that it has had to effectively handle large repositories from day one. Git is written in C, reducing the overhead of run times associated with higher-level languages. Speed and performance has been a primary design goal of Git from the start.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 1em;">
          <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: var(--fw-weight);">> Benchmarks</span><br>
          Let's see how common operations stack up against Subversion, a common centralized version control system that is similar to CVS or Perforce. Smaller is faster.
